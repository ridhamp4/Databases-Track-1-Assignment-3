### Quick Start

**1. Start MySQL**
```bash
brew services start mysql          # macOS
sudo systemctl start mysql         # Linux
```

**2. Backend Setup**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate           # macOS / Linux  (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Configure Environment**

Edit `app/backend/.env` with your MySQL and SMTP credentials:
```env
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=root
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_EMAIL=anonymous.cse.iitgn@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=<gmail-app-password>
```
> For Gmail SMTP, use a [Google App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833). OTP features require valid SMTP credentials.

**4. Seed the Database**
```bash
cd app/backend
python seed.py
```
Creates all 22 tables, 63 audit triggers, and sample data.

**5. Start the Backend**
```bash
python app.py
# API server at http://localhost:5001
```

**6. Start the Frontend** (new terminal)
```bash
cd app/iitgn-connect
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend at http://localhost:5173
```

**7. Open** http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Default Login Credentials

All seed users share the password: **`password123`**

| Username        | Name                  | Type         | Admin |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `admin_user`    | System Admin          | Student      | Yes   |
| `laksh_jain`    | Laksh Jain            | Student      | No    |
| `parthiv_p`     | Parthiv Patel         | Student      | No    |
| `ridham_p`      | Ridham Patel          | Student      | No    |
| `shriniket_b`   | Shriniket Behera      | Student      | No    |
| `rudra_s`       | Rudra Singh           | Student      | No    |
| `prof_yogesh`   | Dr. Yogesh K. Meena   | Professor    | No    |
| `prof_anirban`  | Dr. Anirban Dasgupta  | Professor    | No    |
| `alumni_rahul`  | Rahul Sharma          | Alumni       | No    |
| `alumni_priya`  | Priya Verma           | Alumni       | No    |
| `techclub`      | Technical Club IITGN  | Organization | No    |

You can also log in with email (e.g., `laksh.jain@iitgn.ac.in`).

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Make sure venv is activated: `source venv/bin/activate` |
| `Access denied for user 'root'` | Update MySQL credentials in `app/backend/.env` |
| `Can't connect to MySQL server` | Start MySQL: `brew services start mysql` |
| `Port 5001 already in use` | `lsof -ti :5001 \| xargs kill -9` |
| `Port 5173 already in use` | `lsof -ti :5173 \| xargs kill -9` |
| OTP email not received | Check SMTP credentials in `.env` |

## 1. Database Schema, API & Session Management

### Tech Stack

| Layer    | Technology                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite 8, React Router 7       |
| Backend  | Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS   |
| Database | MySQL 8.0+ (raw SQL, no ORM)           |
| Auth     | JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt, Email OTP |
| Email    | Gmail SMTP (python-dotenv)              |

### Database Schema (22 Tables)

All tables are defined in `sql/schema.sql`. The schema uses strict normalization with ISA hierarchy, composite primary keys, and cascading foreign keys.

| Category   | Tables |
|------------|--------|
| **Core (ISA Hierarchy)** | `Member` (supertype), `Student`, `Professor`, `Alumni`, `Organization` (subtypes) |
| **Content** | `Post`, `Comment`, `PostLike`, `Poll`, `PollOption`, `PollVote` |
| **Groups** | `CampusGroup`, `GroupMembership` |
| **Academic** | `Course`, `Enrollment`, `ClassAttendance`, `MessAttendance` |
| **Jobs** | `JobPost`, `ReferralRequest` |
| **Profile** | `ProfileClaimQuestion`, `ProfileClaimVote` |
| **Security** | `AuditLog`, `OTPVerification` |

**Data Integrity Strategy:**
- ISA hierarchy: Member is the supertype; Student/Professor/Alumni/Organization share `MemberID` as both PK and FK with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- No credential duplication: login data stored only in `Member` table
- Cascade deletes on all FK relationships — deleting a Member removes all dependent data automatically
- Composite PKs for join tables: `(PostID, MemberID)` on PostLike, `(GroupID, MemberID)` on GroupMembership, `(StudentID, CourseID, Semester)` on Enrollment

### CRUD API Endpoints

The backend exposes **40+ RESTful API endpoints** across 10 route blueprints. All data-modifying endpoints use raw SQL (no ORM).

### Session Validation

- **JWT Authentication**: Every protected endpoint requires a valid JWT token via `@jwt_required()` decorator
- **Token Structure**: JWT identity = `MemberID`, 24-hour expiry
- **Token Verification**: `GET /api/auth/isAuth` allows the frontend to validate tokens and retrieve user role/expiry
- **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed with bcrypt + salt; no plaintext storage

### Member Portfolio (Profile)

Each member has a rich profile page (`GET /api/profile/:id`) that aggregates:
- Personal info from `Member` table + subtype-specific details (Student: programme/branch/year; Professor: designation/department; Alumni: organization/graduation year; Organization: type/foundation date)
- Recent posts with like/comment counts
- Group memberships with roles
- Profile Claims (Q&A) with community agree/disagree voting
- Privacy controls: members can toggle visibility of email, contact number, and Q&A section via `PUT /api/settings/privacy`

## 2. Security, Access Control & Audit Logging

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Full CRUD on all members, groups, posts, comments, jobs. Can view system stats dashboard. Can run raw SQL queries. Self-delete protection. |
| **Regular User** | Create/edit/delete **own** posts, comments, and profile claims. View other profiles (read-only). Join/leave groups. |
| **Alumni** | Regular permissions + create/edit/delete job postings, manage incoming referral requests (approve/reject). |
| **Student** | Regular permissions + submit referral requests, view attendance records. |
| **Professor** | Regular permissions (no extra privileges currently). |
| **Organization** | Regular permissions (no extra privileges currently). |

**RBAC Implementation:**
- **`admin_required()` decorator** (`app/backend/routes/admin.py`): Applied to all `/api/admin/*` endpoints. Queries `IsAdmin` on the `Member` table before allowing access. Non-admin users get `403 Forbidden` and the attempt is logged.
- **Ownership checks**: Edit/delete on posts, comments, profile claims verify `AuthorID == current_user_id` before allowing modification.
- **Type-based restrictions**: Job posting is restricted to `MemberType = 'Alumni'`. Referral requests are restricted to Students. These are enforced in the route handlers.

### Role-Based UI Visibility

| Feature             | Student | Alumni | Professor | Organization | Admin |
|---------------------|---------|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Jobs & Referrals    | View + Request Referral | View + Post Jobs | Hidden | Hidden | View + Delete |
| My Referrals Tab    | Yes     | Referral Requests | N/A | N/A | Hidden |
| Attendance          | Full    | Hidden | Hidden | Full | Leaderboard Only |
| Admin Dashboard     | Hidden  | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Full Access |
| SQL Console         | Hidden  | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Full Access |

### Proper Deletion Integrity

All foreign key relationships use `ON DELETE CASCADE`, ensuring referential integrity:
- Deleting a **Member** automatically removes their Student/Professor/Alumni/Organization subtype row, all their posts, comments, likes, poll votes, group memberships, job posts, referral requests, profile claims, and claim votes.
- Deleting a **Post** removes all its comments and likes.
- Deleting a **Poll** removes all its options and votes.
- Deleting a **CampusGroup** removes all memberships and unscopes associated posts.
- Admin delete operations are logged in the audit trail.

### Unauthorized Access Logging

IITGN Connect uses a **two-layer security logging system**:

#### Layer 1: Unauthorized API Request Detection (`logs/audit.log`)

Custom JWT error handlers catch and log all unauthorized API access attempts:

```
# Missing JWT token
[USER:UNAUTHORIZED] [ACTION:UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS] — Missing/invalid JWT on GET /api/posts

# Expired JWT token
[USER:EXPIRED_TOKEN] [ACTION:UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS] — Expired JWT (user_id=1) on GET /api/posts

# Tampered/fake JWT token
[USER:INVALID_TOKEN] [ACTION:UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS] — Invalid/tampered JWT on GET /api/posts

# Non-admin accessing admin endpoint (RBAC violation)
[USER:laksh_jain] [ACTION:FORBIDDEN_ACCESS] — Non-admin user 'laksh_jain' attempted GET /api/admin/stats
```

To view unauthorized API attempts:
```bash
grep -E "UNAUTHORIZED|FORBIDDEN|INVALID_TOKEN|EXPIRED_TOKEN" logs/audit.log
```

#### Layer 2: Direct DB Modification Detection (AuditLog table + 63 MySQL Triggers)

63 MySQL triggers (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on all 21 tables) detect operations that bypass the API:

- **API-based operations**: `db.py` sets `@app_username` MySQL session variable before every query. Triggers read this and log with `IsAuthorized = TRUE`.
- **Direct SQL access**: `@app_username` is NULL (not set by any API call). Triggers log with `IsAuthorized = FALSE` and `Username = 'DIRECT_DB_ACCESS'`.

```sql
-- Find all unauthorized direct DB modifications:
SELECT * FROM AuditLog WHERE IsAuthorized = FALSE;

-- Test it: run this directly in MySQL CLI (bypasses the API)
UPDATE Post SET Content = 'Hacked!' WHERE PostID = 1;

-- Check the AuditLog — flagged as unauthorized
SELECT * FROM AuditLog WHERE IsAuthorized = FALSE AND Action = 'UPDATE_POST';
```

---

## 3. Indexing & Query Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

We analyzed every SQL query in the Flask API route handlers and identified columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, and correlated subqueries. **26 custom indexes** were created in `sql/indexes.sql`.

| # | Index Name | Table | Column(s) | Query Pattern |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | `idx_post_authorid` | Post | AuthorID | Profile page: posts by author |
| 2 | `idx_post_groupid` | Post | GroupID | Group feed: `WHERE GroupID = ?` |
| 3 | `idx_post_groupid_createdat` | Post | (GroupID, CreatedAt DESC) | Group posts sorted by date — eliminates filesort |
| 4 | `idx_post_createdat` | Post | CreatedAt DESC | Global feed: `ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC` |
| 5 | `idx_post_authorid_createdat` | Post | (AuthorID, CreatedAt DESC) | Profile: recent posts by author |
| 6 | `idx_comment_postid_createdat` | Comment | (PostID, CreatedAt ASC) | Comments per post, sorted chronologically |
| 7 | `idx_comment_postid` | Comment | PostID | Comment count subquery, CASCADE deletes |
| 8 | `idx_comment_authorid` | Comment | AuthorID | JOIN to Member for comment author |
| 9 | `idx_postlike_memberid` | PostLike | MemberID | "Liked posts by user" reverse lookup |
| 10 | `idx_groupmembership_memberid` | GroupMembership | MemberID | User's groups lookup |
| 11 | `idx_campusgroup_adminid` | CampusGroup | AdminID | JOIN to Member for group admin |
| 12 | `idx_member_name` | Member | Name | Member search: `ORDER BY Name` |
| 13 | `idx_member_membertype` | Member | MemberType | Member filter: `WHERE MemberType = ?` |
| 14 | `idx_poll_createdat` | Poll | CreatedAt DESC | Poll listing sorted by date |
| 15 | `idx_poll_creatorid` | Poll | CreatorID | JOIN to Member for poll creator |
| 16 | `idx_polloption_pollid` | PollOption | PollID | Options per poll |
| 17 | `idx_pollvote_memberid` | PollVote | MemberID | User's vote check |

| 20 | `idx_referral_targetalumniid_requestedat` | ReferralRequest | (TargetAlumniID, RequestedAt DESC) | Alumni referral dashboard |
| 21 | `idx_referral_studentid_requestedat` | ReferralRequest | (StudentID, RequestedAt DESC) | Student referral history |
| 22 | `idx_classattendance_studentid_date` | ClassAttendance | (StudentID, RecordDate) | Attendance by student + date range |
| 23 | `idx_classattendance_courseid` | ClassAttendance | CourseID | JOIN to Course |
| 24 | `idx_messattendance_studentid_date` | MessAttendance | (StudentID, RecordDate) | Mess attendance by student + date |
| 25 | `idx_profileclaim_memberid` | ProfileClaimQuestion | MemberID | Claims per member profile |
| 26 | `idx_enrollment_courseid` | Enrollment | CourseID | Course detail lookups |

**Index types used:**
- **Single-column indexes**: Simple WHERE/JOIN lookups (e.g., `idx_post_authorid`)
- **Composite indexes**: Filter + sort on different columns (e.g., `idx_post_groupid_createdat` covers `WHERE GroupID = ? ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC`)
- **Descending indexes**: MySQL 8.0+ DESC key parts for `ORDER BY ... DESC` optimization

### Query Profiling & Benchmarking

The benchmarking script (`app/backend/benchmark.py`) measures performance across **10 representative queries** covering the most critical API endpoints:

1. **Global Post Feed** — full feed with author info, like/comment counts
2. **Group Posts** — group-filtered feed with counts
3. **Post Comments** — comments per post with author details
4. **User Profile Posts** — recent posts by a member
5. **Class Attendance** — monthly attendance with course info
6. **Mess Attendance** — monthly mess records
7. **Job Listings** — all jobs with alumni info
8. **Referral Requests** — alumni's incoming referrals
9. **Polls with Options & Votes** — poll listing with creator info
10. **Member Search by Type** — filtered member directory

**Methodology:**
- Bulk data generation (~2000 posts, 5000 comments, 8000 likes, 10000+ attendance records) to ensure MySQL optimizer uses indexes
- `IGNORE INDEX` hints in "before" queries to simulate no-index state
- Normal queries for "after" state (using all indexes)
- 100 iterations per query for statistical reliability
- EXPLAIN analysis to verify access type changes

**Results Summary:**

| Query | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Speedup |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Global Post Feed | 3112.32 | 12.74 | **+99.6%** |
| Group Posts | 551.62 | 2.20 | **+99.6%** |
| Post Comments | 1.66 | 0.14 | **+91.7%** |
| User Profile Posts | 9.57 | 0.24 | **+97.5%** |
| Class Attendance | 3.46 | 0.84 | **+75.6%** |
| Mess Attendance | 2.77 | 1.05 | **+62.1%** |
| Job Listings | 0.68 | 0.71 | -3.5% |
| Referral Requests | 0.24 | 0.13 | **+44.7%** |
| Polls | 0.54 | 0.56 | -4.2% |
| Member Search | 0.72 | 0.80 | -11.1% |
| **Average** | | | **+55.2%** |

The top queries (Global Feed, Group Posts, Profile Posts) show **95-99%+ speedup** because they involve correlated subqueries and JOINs across large tables where indexes eliminate full table scans.

To run benchmarks yourself:
```bash
cd app/backend
python benchmark.py
```

## 4. Benchmarking Report & EXPLAIN Analysis

The full optimization report is in **`report.ipynb`** (Jupyter Notebook). It contains:

1. **Schema Design** — ER summary, table descriptions, data integrity strategy
2. **Security — Session Validation & RBAC** — JWT flow, role permissions, audit logging mechanism
3. **Indexing Strategy** — All 26 indexes with rationale tied to specific query patterns
4. **Performance Benchmarking** — Execution time comparison table, before vs after bar charts, speedup percentage chart
5. **EXPLAIN Plan Analysis** — Side-by-side EXPLAIN output for each query showing:
   - Access type changes (`ALL` → `ref`, `eq_ref`)
   - Key usage changes (`None` → custom index names)
   - Row estimate reductions
   - Filesort elimination

### Generated Charts (in `app/backend/benchmarks/`)

| Chart | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `before_vs_after.png` | Grouped bar chart comparing execution times |
| `speedup_pct.png` | Speedup percentage per query |
| `explain_keys.png` | EXPLAIN key usage comparison (before vs after) |

To regenerate the report:
```bash
# First run the benchmark
cd app/backend
python benchmark.py

# Then open the notebook
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
# Re-run all cells
```

## 5. Video Walkthrough

> **Video Link:** [ VIDEO LINK WILL BE ADDED ]

The video demonstration covers:
1. **UI & API Functionality** — Walkthrough of all features: login, feed, posts, comments, likes, groups, polls, jobs, referrals, attendance, profiles, settings
2. **RBAC Enforcement** — Side-by-side comparison of Admin vs Regular User login showing different sidebar options, restricted endpoints, and forbidden access handling
3. **Security Logging** — Demonstration of:
   - Unauthorized API access attempts (expired/missing/tampered tokens)
   - RBAC violation logging (non-admin accessing admin endpoints)
   - Direct DB modification detection via MySQL triggers
